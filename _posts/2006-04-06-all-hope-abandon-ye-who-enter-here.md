There have been naysayers who thought I had not the sack that hangs between my legs to do the necessary to secure the goals I so arduously seek. You know who you are. And you know what?

_Shut up._

I have faced, not once, not twice, but thrice the fury of the Brazilian salesman working on _heavy_ commission. But I planned, schemed and executed beautifully, on time and under budget. In heavy traffic I crossed the Beast, found the places, got my wares and made it back alive, successfully.

And it wasn't in the ease of the evening, after work when time is not a factor. And  it certainly was not on a weekend when I have better adventures to chase, more dangerous and less well-funded. No, it was during a maddeningly well-planned lunch hour that I sought my instrument, my talisman. With all my skills and wits about me did I face the insanity of crossing the Beast at mid-day, when the motorcycle boys are out in full force and when people are _hungry_. With all my innate sense of direction did I tell the cabbie where to go, _in the rain_, turning onto streets only known to me from a 300 mile orbit picture on Google Maps. With all my fierce ice-coldery did I stand in the face of the musical store sales-wretch and make him bow to my clear American Express Blue card, which apparently they don't have in Brazil.

_“I'm not sure we can take this clear, futuristic card of credit. I've never seen it's equal.”_

_“Take it! Take it, vile scum! Feed from my credit, which is immaculate as it is foreign. You shall know no better reward (and I'll get the points).”_

_“I cannot as I don't know the card code. It's written in some kind of alien language I can't read.”_

_“Fool, the card is clear and you're reading it from behind!”_

_“Ahh. I hear you master. Your power is great indeed. I will throw in a power cable and carrying case for you.”_

_“You are wise.”_

And so it was that I bought my guitar.

Victory over the Beast, and I even had time to eat an _esfiha_ when I got back. I am -- and please understand that I say this with all my modesty -- the shit.

...and my guitar rocks. Hard.
