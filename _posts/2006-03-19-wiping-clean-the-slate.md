If nature were to one day be fed up with man for the obscene amounts of pollutants we toss into the mix, _Cubatão_ would be the first place to be removed from the surface like picking a scab.

Sometimes I think it's a good thing I can't will mountains to crumble over an entire city.

Then I see _Cubatão_ in the shadow of the dying _serra_ smack in the middle of the _Mata Atlantica_, and it's obvious that we simply don't need the help.
