Putting this in the front or the end (where it might be misunderstood as an actual disclaimer) would've made no sense, since it's mostly a warning. That's why it's in the middle somewhere; where it's least likely to be read. Lucky you.

The stuff I write in here is not a journal, _per se_, though sometime it takes on a similar form. Some of it is completely made up, and some of it is not. Some characteristics of the person telling the story are me and some are not.

I feel it necessary to say this before people who may read this think that these are all my thoughts or actions; that I spend too much time in strange hotels drinking variations of wine, bourbon, martinis and beer, often too much, and often far too alone for the comfort of society. That I dream too much, try too hard and that were I to fail I would fall so hard that my mind would snap and I'd end up a hermit in the south pacific, looking for coconuts with which to break crabs.

It's not a pretty thought.

The truth is I'm getting some strange mail about these entries and this is my warning if you want to invest the time to peruse this place, lest you think I'm either in need of some serious counseling or else a sharp attorney very soon.

They're just words.

... remember that if you venture into my head.
