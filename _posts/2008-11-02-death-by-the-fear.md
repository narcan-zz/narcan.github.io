Republicans,

“_Democracy depends on people who have the courage to stand up and be critical; for it is only from the crucible of disagreement among Americans that the best decisions are made_.”

In this light, you and I are a cornerstone of democracy at the moment, eh?

Indeed. Are we calm yet? Are we willing to talk without thrusting insults never called for? Maybe. You tell me. But in the meantime, things are happening -- crazy, bad things -- and some of them have very much to do with the 6th district of Minnesota.

And so much for all that. Fine. Fuck it. We have our disagreements, both in politics and in the other's decency. That's a two-way street, though, kids.

But -- and this concerns you, District 6 of Minnesota. Pay attention.

On Oct. 17, your crazy-lady representative, Michele Bachmann, appeared on MSNBC’s Hardball and called for a McCarthyite investigation into the “anti-American” activities of the people she considers liberals. Given her view of the spectrum, that's a shitload of people. Since you're politically educated, as you say, I trust you know what McCarthyite investigations” refers to. And if you don't, look up words like “doom” and “shameful” and you'll probably come to it somewhere.

Her words are, no matter how you slice the dice of your leanings, a little scary for the 21st century and I hope you'll look beyond the jerk you think is feeding you lines. I'm only bringing something to your eyes in a different light -- you deal with it how you will, and you'll disappoint no one on this side of the thread since there is nothing to live up to. I just hope you actually consider what these words mean coming from someone Inside the halls of your (our) government.

“I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America?”

Then, to make matters more weird, yesterday in a Minnesota Public Radio debate, Bachmann dismissed the significance of her remarks, saying that no one in the state even cares about what she says.

From what I hear, Minnesotans were paying close attention to her comments one way or the other and “it’s not what people are interested in” is hardly the best way to describe it. Nevermind that 40% of voters said they were less likely to support Bachman after her comments on Hardball.

_“I, for one, would like to know exactly how one qualifies as anti-American in her eyes.”_

_“The ghost of Joe McCarthy is back and representing the Sixth District of Minnesota.”_

I mean, Jesus Christ. This is the first step towards a society of Fear and Loathing in its ugliest form. This is what breeds the first steps of a police state. This is bad stuff. Someone -- all of you in the 6th District -- get this woman out from where she can do some serious damage. Put in someone evil, someone corrupt, like Alaska did...whatever. Just don't reelect a lunatic to the office, you know?

In case you didn't know who's running against her (she IS up for reelection), the man's name is Elwyn Tinklenberg.

Yes, he's a democrat.

Yes, it's an unfortunate name.

No, he's not a terrorist.

No, he doesn't stand against all of your “values”. He just disagrees with a few of them. Healthily. Read about the man in a source that you consider neither red OR blue. Make a judgment and vote according to what you Know, not what you feel.

Or just stay home. That works too.
