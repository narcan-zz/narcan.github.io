When you stumble off of a dream you don't really wake. When you brain becomes involved in emotional entanglements with its own subconscious creations and you don't provide adequate time to drown the rogue neurons, a dark day indeed will lay before you. A day that follows such awakenings is sure to be rife with irrationalities and general suckage.

Lately, with the new found everything that comes along with married life, I find that the demons, though muffled, are there...not yelling or whispering but just there. Whereas they used to keep me till odd hours of the night with the screen alight, they now seem satisfied creeping stealthily into my thoughts and nighttime dreams. I find them lurking in my rapid eye movement, sinister and dark like the confusion they come to instill.

But I'm not one to cower in the face of pain or limitation.Already there are plans in motion. _Think of that_. At the merest _mention_ of going to _REI_ yesterday (a store, among few, towards which I have a clinical addiction), thoughts of travel flooded my mind. Before a minute had passed, I had already looked up two separate itineraries and was already filtering out tickets by prices. Images of Pyramids, Sphinxes, tombs and ancient runes came forth. My recovering health improved by a factor of days in a matter of minutes and the merest whisper of solidifying plans. What chance have my foes of defeating me while I am armed with such spirit and determination?

_Eat shit demons_. I am the victor this round, as in all other rounds before this. You may taunt and persist, but you will never finish me. You have not the conditioning necessary to contest my will. You'll be back --- this I know --- but I will be here, once again, armed with thousands of frequent flier miles and the will to use them to the end of the Earth.

Also, there may have been a haiku in there somewhere. I recognize that.
