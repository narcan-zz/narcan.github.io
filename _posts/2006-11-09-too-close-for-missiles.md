The Bay is stuck in transition between glorious autumn and vengeful winter. The cold and icy rain seeps through the very fabric of reality and grey skies float without meaning over the mountain, east of the tunnel.

Or so I'm told.

I didn't see any of it because it's 85 degrees and sunny like you wouldn't believe over in LA.

That's right kids. I'm back from a euro-escapade that made sense in a way things simply haven't for a while. I wandered lonely dark streets at odd hours of the night --- hopping in and out of pubs, getting tanked when I should be asleep, conversing with hobos in small dives in the English countryside and facing the daily dosage of bullshit to get through it all --- it can be done. But now I'm back and must organize my affairs if things are going to get done.

The past few days have been a blur. Arriving Sunday afternoon and hoovering between consciousness and bill-paying for most of Monday, only to wake up early and fly to LA on Tuesday to continue with the meaningless drable of daily routine.

God. Flying to LA...no, not even LA --- Orange County on a Tuesday morning is really something else. You think you see strange things when the sun goes down and lights go out, but friends, Orange County airport (_John-mother-fucking-Wayne_ Airport, mind you) on a Tuesday morning takes the ball. It's a zoo, but not in the sense that there are a lot of people moving around and acting like animals...no, no. That would be bearable. I could close my eyes and pretend to be asleep to avoid that mess.

But this...spectacle, in all of its obscenity just sort of creeps me out. You should witness the number of midwesterners on the planes and walking all over the goddam airport and you should _hear_ the shit these people are saying...

I'm sure it doesn't help that yesterday was election day and the Bush machine got told what's up in pathetic sort of way, even though the gloves did not come off like they should have. Oh well.

I digress. These people at the John-Wayne Airport walk around mumbling rants about the country going down the tube because now their republican stronghold is no more and now it's going to take forever to do things though I guess it's not going “all that well” over in Iraq and _blah blah something something_ god I hate you all. Not that I think this is the first ray of sunshine in a bursting dawn of awakening to come, but the democrats, though weak and silly and disorganized beyond belief, are a lesser evil and this may...MAY, slow the decline of this nation.

Fuck it, like I care. I'm moving to the fuckin EU, or Bali. Somewhere that a street vendor can be a respected member of the community and where no one knows about Britney Spears' divorce before they know who won the election for Governor. You people make me sick.
