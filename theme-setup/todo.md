## Further Customization

Jekyll 2.x added support for Sass files making it much easier to modify a theme's fonts and colors. By editing values found in `_sass/variables.scss` you can fine tune the site's colors and typography.

For example if you wanted a red background instead of white you'd change `$bodycolor: #fff;` to `$bodycolor: $cc0033;`.

To modify the site's JavaScript files I setup a Grunt build script to lint/concatenate/minify all scripts into `scripts.min.js`. [Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), then [install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), and then finally install the dependencies for the theme contained in `package.json`:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install
{% endhighlight %}

From the theme's root, use `grunt` to concatenate JavaScript files and optimize `.jpg`, `.png` and `.svg` files in the `images/` folder.

You can also use `grunt dev` in combination with `bundle exec jekyll serve` to watch for updates in JS files that Grunt will then automatically re-build as you write your code, which will in turn auto-generate your Jekyll site when developing locally.
