The night was already sweating on my shoulders as I rose from the 34th street subway station at 33rd and 7th and then walked up to 34th street. The air was heavy from a constipated afternoon that had threatened rain the whole day through and then --- nothing. My shirt, a cheap Dutch cotton fabric too thick for this climate, was no longer breathing at all and the rum from earlier was wearing thin. And I still had to find my way across town to get home.

I'd just taken the 1 train down from the Upper West Side after an evening discussing the finer points of life with some friends up near Columbia. Time was on my side, I could tell, by the empty sidewalks and the delivery trucks idling on the filthy asphalt. Other than the dudes behind them chucking boxes to each other in a production line attempt to restock the H&Ms and Macy's before 9 am the next morning, there was an obvious absence of energy in the air, a sort of ethereal or existential vacuum. The streets were still full, thick with the traffic that is inherent to Manhattan almost 24-7, but there were few human beings there to feel it.

I looked back towards 8th Avenue and saw no sign of a bus, so I started walking, thinking maybe I'd check the bus schedule at Herald Square.

I walked on viscously, like the legs of alcohol running down the glassy side of a tumbler of newly finished whiskey. The heat pushing back against me and impeding my progress. As I waited at 5th Avenue for a break in traffic long enough to cross I started thinking about the incongruities in the perceptions and the realities of life in New York

(comment here on the preceding descriptions of the dirty streets but explain how alive they felt...illustrate how though the streets are covered in trash bags every night, and always seems like they need a street sweeper, unlike places like Boston, they are always clean given how many fucking people there are. And besides, there's something about those trash bags and the people who pile them, who carry them, that really seems more like feeding the city than anything else...)

...a tall, homeless-looking black man getting a hand-job from a white chick in Murray Hill against a railing on 34th street.

"Excuse me," she said, "can you just settle, um..."

I looked right at her, giving her some leeway.

"Pizza," she asked, looking up towards ____ on the north side of 34th, "or McDonald's," she said, turning her head south on 3rd Avenue.

"Pizza," I said, not even letting her put a period on her sentence. "You're welcome."

the bus beat me by 100 yards...
