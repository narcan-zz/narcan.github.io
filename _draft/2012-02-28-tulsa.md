It was one those flights that is filled to the brim with elite access and star alliance gold members. Business travelers only. _Right_, I thought. _Who the fuck else would fly to Tulsa this early on a weekday?_

The gig was so typical that it took no effort at all. The motions were familiar and scripted and the only time my brain really kicked in was when I wandered the streets outside, looking for decent coffee. But for the first time in years, I had a sense of levity about the drab environment, a soulful cheer that made the place fascinating in its lifelessness, as opposed to depressingly inane.
