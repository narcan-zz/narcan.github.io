# Tulsa

It was one those flights that is filled to the brim with elite access and star alliance gold members. Business travelers only. _Right_, I thought. _Who the fuck else would fly to Tulsa this early on a weekday?_

I had been coming in regularly every week from New York, for several weeks. Flying out of Laguardia at five in the morning like some kind of midnight rat, and then ducking out on Thursday afternoon, depleted and bored and still having to face a connection at O'Hare.

The gig was so typical that it took no effort at all. The motions were familiar and scripted and the only time my brain really kicked in was when I wandered the streets outside, looking for decent coffee. But for the first time in years, I had a sense of levity about the drab environment, a soulful cheer that made the place fascinating in its lifelessness, as opposed to depressingly inane.
