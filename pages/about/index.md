For a stable, sane, productive member of society (all arguable, but let’s not complicate things), I’m far too mobile and unrooted. I travel quite a bit for a job that is simultaneously my greatest privilege and my worst burden.

So I write. And I write. Travel pieces, political journalism (a stretch from ranting but, still), short stories, poetry and other such riff-raff — it’s all road writing. I contribute to a handful of publications and will just keep going until something gives out, or someone gives in. Yeah.

But _who cares_? You’re not here for this self-glorifying crap; you’re here because you want to see the merchandise; _the stuff_. Ok, then. [Have at it](http://writtenrhetoric.com/stories/ "Written Rhetoric Stories").

Oscar’s day job consists of saying & writing banter for which corporate executives pay outrageous amounts to shelve and ignore. He’s a consultant at one of the largest software firms in the world, and his clients are in major capitals all over the globe. From São Paulo to Prague, from Oslo to Riyadh, Oscar jots his notes on travel, corporate life, fast adventures and a company dime and puts his words [here](http://writtenrhetoric.com/stories "Written Rhetoric Stories").

Dylan is our political correspondent, bold and fiery as his fuse is short. He is a well-read, on-location kind of writer and is no stranger to travel. Intimately familiar with many distant and dark corners of the Earth, Dylan brings a new kind of blood to his vicious style of journalism. He sends his words, notes and effusive rants of observation, commentary and occasional judgement to be read [here](http://writtenrhetoric.com "Written Rhetoric Blog").
